    "\n",
    "### What is programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++. \n",
    "\n",
    "A program can be seen as the recipe of a dish. It is a set of instructions that tell the computer how to perform a task. The computer executes the program, following each step sequentially, until it reaches the end of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "We develop algorithms to solve problems. An algorithm is a set of instructions that describe how to get a task done. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as JavaScript, C++, Python, Java or C# to name a few, in contrast to low-level languages, such as assembly language or machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers work with binary code, a sequence of 0s and 1s. These 0s and 1s are called bits. A bit is the smallest unit of data in a computer. A bit can hold only one of two values: 0 or 1, corresponding to the electrical values of off or on, respectively. 8 bits form a byte, which can represent values from 0 to 255.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, high-level languages are human-friendly. They are easier to learn, read, and maintain. They are also portable, meaning that they can run on different operating systems with few or no modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decimal to binary conversion:\n",
    "- 0 = 0\n",
    "- 1 = 1\n",
    "- 2 = 10\n",
    "- 3 = 11\n",
    "- 4 = 100\n",
    "- 5 = 101\n",
    "- 6 = 110\n",
    "- 7 = 111\n",
    "- 8 = 1000\n",
    "- 9 = 1001\n",
    "- 10 = 1010\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "From texts, to numbers, images, music, videos, websites, ... everything is represented in binary code in a computer.\n"

    "## 4. Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive, and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently, whereas other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a very versatile language. It can be used for web development, data science, machine learning, and many other things. It is also a great first language for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991 and it is managed by the Python Software Foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some years ago, it was said to be slow and it was not much used in general. However, with the advances in hardware (computers are now a days thousands of times faster) plus the development and optimization of the core language and its libraries, it has become one of the most popular languages in the world.

    "## 6. How to run Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python REPL:**  \n",
    "The Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) is a simple interactive shell that executes Python code one line at a time. It is useful for testing small code snippets and exploring the Python language. To start the Python REPL, open the terminal and type python or python3 depending on your installation. You should see the Python prompt (>>>). You can type any Python code at the prompt and press Enter to execute it. For example, you can type 2 + 2 and press Enter. The Python REPL will print the result of the expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python Scripts:**  \n",
    "The most general way of programming in Python is by writing Python scripts. A Python script is a text file with a .py extension that contains Python code. To run a Python script, you need to use the Python interpreter. The Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code. It is installed on your computer when you install Python. To run a Python script, open the terminal and type python followed by the path to the script. For example, if you have a script called hello.py in the current directory, you can run it by typing python hello.py. The Python interpreter will read the script and execute its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebooks:**  \n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter Notebook is a great tool for data analysis. It allows you to write Python code interactively and view the results in the same document. To start Jupyter Notebook, create a file with the extension .ipynb in VSCode. This will open a new notebook in a new tab. You can type Python code in the cells and press Shift + Enter to execute them. You can also add text and images to the cells using Markdown. In order to create new cells you can press B (Below) or A (Above) in the keyboard or use the buttons in the top menu. You can also change the type of the cell from Code to Markdown with the letters Y and M respectively or with the cell options. To run the code in a cell, you can press Shift + Enter or click the Run button in the top menu. To stop the execution of a cell, you can press the Stop button in the top menu. To restart the kernel, you can press the Restart button in the top menu. To save the notebook, you can press Ctrl + S or click the Save button in the top menu. We can alternatively run Jupyter Notebooks online on Google Colab (https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) or locally using Anaconda."

Errors are not bad, they are a normal part of programming. They are a way for the computer to tell you that something is wrong. You can use the error message to figure out what is wrong and fix it.\n",

    "At first they are difficult to understand and resolve, but with practice you'll get better at it. The most common thing to do if you don't know how to fix an error is to search for the error message online at Google for example. You'll find that most errors have been asked and answered before on websites like Stack Overflow. "
