story = """In the year 2023, humanity had made a significant leap in
technology. It was in 2023 when we finally established the first human
colony on Mars. The project, aptly named "Mars 2023", was a testament to
human will and innovation.

The world watched in anticipation as the first crew members of Mars 2023
took their first steps on the red planet. It was a moment that echoed Neil
Armstrong's historic moon landing, but this time in the year 2023, and on a
whole new planet.

Back on Earth, in 2023, people celebrated this achievement. It was a beacon
of hope in a world that had seen its share of challenges. The year 2023
marked a new era for humanity, one where the stars were no longer out of our
reach.

By the end of 2023, we had not only reached Mars but created a sustainable
living environment there. The year 2023 will forever be remembered as the
year we truly became a space-faring civilization.
